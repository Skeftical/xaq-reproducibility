XAQ : eXplaining Aggregate Queries
==================================

This repository was created to enhance the reproducibility efforts for our paper. We intend to extend and add helper scripts that would allow the reproducibility of our experiments. We have not included any datasets as these would make the repository really large.
For now, interested parties can contact f.savva.1@research.gla.ac.uk to get a hold of the datasets.

The models used were coded using Jupyter Notebooks so that the model can be interactively debugged.
